                        <p>Imagine that Sidewalk Labs have delivered a proposal to build a completely new neighborhood at Grønlikaia in Oslo.</p>
                        <p>The proposal includes 2000 new apartments, shops, restaurants, and connection to the Oslo transit system-all supported by the world’s most advanced IoT software, sensors, and machine learning algorithms.
                        The neighborhood will only include rental apartments, priced well below the average price in Oslo, but you will need to sign terms and conditions allowing personal data to be collected by Sidewalk Labs. </p>
                        <p>Your group of experts have been asked to evaluate this proposal and provide a response to Oslo City Council. Use the form below to guide and summarize your discussions. </p>

                            <li>The smart city can also be a very safe area, which is good for the people who lives there. And the security system will most likely also be very good, because the smart city knows all the people and the things that are happening in the city. </li>
                            <li>All of the new shops and restaurants are a good solution for all of the people who live there to get a job. </li>

                        <p>After some discussion, the overall vote from the group is a yes. Right now, ca. 54% of the population lives in cities, and this number is expected to reach 66% by 2050, <a href = https://population.un.org/wup/publications/files/wup2014-highlights.pdf>United Nations.</a> This means several million more people will be living in cities as the years pass. Environmental, economic and social sustainability is needed to make this shift viable.</p>

                        <p>A smart city is said to be a place where the information is near perfect, which is believed to vastly improve the quality of life. The information could be about traffic, accidents, products and their carbon footprint, crime, etc. This could help the citizens make more informed choices and boost the safety in cities.
                            When it comes to the environment, smart cities are also helpful to reduce carbon footprint, energy consumption and pollution.The United Nations Development Programme, said in 2020, that cities are responsible for 70% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and can lead to natural disasters, like flooding or heat. <a href =https://earth.org/smart-cities-climate-change/ > Smart cities and climate change.</a></p>

                        <p>Even though the group voted for a yes, there are some aspects of the smart cities that need further research. Amnesty International have expressed their concern about how smart cities may have been developed at the expense of human rights, including privacy and freedom of expression.
                            For a safe and transparent country/regime, the access to data could improve the quality of life. But for an authoritarian regime, or corrupt officials, a smart city and its data can be used as a tool to manipulate and control citizens <a href = https://earth.org/what-is-a-smart-city > Smart cities and privacy issues.</a> 
                            Another safety hazard are cyber-attacks, these could shut-down or compromise vital services, like water or electricity. In previous ransom-cases attacks have also locked city staff from their computers and networks, to bring operations to a halt until they pay large sums of money.
                            The cyber-attackers could also get a hold of the citizens private information, data, and video footage, and use this against them.</p>
